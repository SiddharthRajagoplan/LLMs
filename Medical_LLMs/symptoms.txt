I woke up this morning with a pounding headache and a feeling of extreme fatigue.
My throat is incredibly sore, and every swallow feels painful and scratchy.
I've been experiencing chills and body aches all day, and it's getting worse.
I can't seem to stop coughing, and my chest feels tight and congested.
My nose won't stop running, and I've gone through a whole box of tissues already.
I suddenly developed a high fever, and my body temperature is spiking.
I've been feeling nauseous and have no appetite for the past few hours.
I'm having difficulty breathing, and even simple tasks leave me short of breath.
I noticed a sudden loss of taste and smell, and it's really concerning.
My joints are aching, and I'm experiencing overall muscle weakness and fatigue.
